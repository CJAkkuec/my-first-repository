# My first day on GitHub

Today I learned that version control is an **essential** part of my career as web developer.

Some keywords that I should remember for later are: 

- git
- GitHub
- version control
- repository
- commit
- hash

> The next 3 months will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things every day.
